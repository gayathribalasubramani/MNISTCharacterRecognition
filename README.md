# TensorFlow
Getting started with TensorFlow


Get the MNIST data 

Use softmax regressions

Create a function that is a model for recognizing digits, based on looking at every pixel in the image

Use TensorFlow to train the model to recognize digits by having it "look" at thousands of examples (and run our first TensorFlow session to do so)

Check the model's accuracy with our test data
